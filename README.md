### This was a kaggle in class competition. Algorithm was fixed to random forest, and metric is oob_score.

During ML express course we arranged small in class competition.
This dataset is very interesting with a lot of things to do and this solution still could be improved.

Algorithms we should use was Random Forest and metric was itâ€™s oob_score.


This restriction made me focus on feature engineering, which I enjoyed a lot.
I made a lot of data modification, synthesized new features based on old ones, learned how to handle categorial features and eve found a way to improve my solution with external data.

This is one of my favorite competitions also because here all feature really made sense and a good solution potentially could make the world a better place.


### Potential improvements:
- add coat type based on breed
- implement different solvers for dogs and cats
